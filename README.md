# hao-backprop-test

A minimal HTTP service test project for backprop integration testing.

## Overview

This is a lightweight Python Flask application designed specifically for integration testing scenarios within backpropagation system ecosystems. The service provides a predictable HTTP endpoint that returns consistent responses for automated testing workflows.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: Runtime environment
- **Flask**: Minimal web framework (sole external dependency)
- **HTTP/1.1**: Standard protocol compliance for universal compatibility

## Features

- **Deterministic Responses**: Returns identical "Hello, World!" for all HTTP methods
- **Localhost-Only Access**: Secure test isolation binding to 127.0.0.1:3000
- **Zero-Dependency Architecture**: Uses only Python standard library + Flask
- **Integration Testing Ready**: Compatible with all HTTP-based testing frameworks
- **Minimal Resource Footprint**: Optimized for CI/CD environments

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Service

Start the HTTP service:
```bash
python app.py
```

The service will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

You should see the startup message:
```
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

## Usage

The service responds to all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) with the same response:

```bash
# Example requests
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:3000/any/path
```

All requests return:
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Content-Type**: text/plain
- **Body**: Hello, World!

## Integration Testing

This service is designed as a reliable test fixture for:
- HTTP client validation
- Integration test scenarios
- CI/CD pipeline testing
- API behavior verification

The deterministic response pattern ensures consistent test results across all testing scenarios.

## Architecture

- **Single Process**: Flask development server with synchronous request handling
- **Stateless Operation**: No data persistence or session management
- **Localhost Binding**: Security isolation prevents external network access
- **Static Responses**: Eliminates processing variability for reliable testing
